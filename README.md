        * Use Coordinator to handle delegates
        * to pass .constant as @Binding vars for SwiftUI PreviewProvider
    * Add custom storyboard in SwiftUI project and communication with it via UIViewControllerRepresentable
    * PersonPhotoImagePickerViewController from camera and gallery via UIViewControllerRepresentable. This is creating UI with code using UIKit
    * Use Photo Editor ( earlier version swift ) via UIViewControllerRepresentable. This is using UI with storyboard
    * ~~Custom AlertControlView via UIViewControllerRepresentable for getting 'name' text from user.~~ (not in use)
    * 'alertSS' functions to call custom alerts with textfield.
    * 'View' extension to print debug messages with PrintView method.
    * Integration / modification of Views created by 'Chris Mash' project [AVPlayer-SwiftUI](https://github.com/ChrisMash/AVPlayer-SwiftUI) for Audio play functionality integration at bottom of LIstView
        * List refill on shuffle array of songs.
        * Add/delete single item to core data in second audio list.

            * 'SourceKitService" and/or 'Swift' process on mac taking max memory, so xcode and all mac proccesses slogs to halt ( macOS Catalina 10.15.6, tried on XCode 11.6 and 11.5). The issue was solved after update of XCode 11.7.
    * Added Navigation view - 'Menu' option in content view.
    * TabSwiftUiView added with Localizable Strings files for "ગુજરાતી" and "मराठी" display in tab.

            * How to localize Label text in "LaunchScreen.storyboard"
                * Refer: [Comment on developer.apple.com forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/86567?answerId=632317022#632317022)
                * [Still could not see text in Arabic in LaunchScreen](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/8714792)
    * Apple Pay test integration
        * Buy with various Landmark items. 
            * Saving Landmark data in document folder after buying, to store status of 'bought'

4. "Play with Grids" ( Work in Progress )
    
5. Geometry ( and Enviornment - Work in Progress ) 
    
6. GIT integration (Github)
    * Added Project to GIT from XCode 11
    * Creation and Commit to master branch from XCode
    
7. Build project from Github with [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/) in cloud. ( concept is still not clear )

8. Coredata
    * usage of .xcdatamodeld
