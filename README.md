## Version

### Topics learned

1. SwiftUI project.
    * @State variables
        * on modification perform some tasks with the help of Hidden Toggle control
        * on modification change another @State variable
        * the modified @State variables should not run in recursive loops.
    * controls 
        * ZStack
        * VStack with rotation effect
        
            ![vstackRotation](readmeResource/vstackRotation.jpg)
        
        * HStack
        * Button with padding, forgroundColor, logic in 'action', open new view with 'sheet'

            ![roundSpecificCorners](readmeResource/roundSpecificCorners.jpg)
        
    * Multiple SwiftUI views loading from contentView
    * JSON service with Codable protocol

        * Testing by loading jsons with multiple image urls to test loading and background saving
    * Loading UIViewControllers via UIViewControllerRepresentable in SwiftUI
        * Use Coordinator to handle delegates
        * to pass .constant as @Binding vars for SwiftUI PreviewProvider
        
            ![CustomPersonPhotoImagePickerViewController](readmeResource/CustomPersonPhotoImagePickerViewController.jpg)
        
    * PersonPhotoImagePickerViewController from camera and gallery via UIViewControllerRepresentable. This is creating UI with code using UIKit
    * Add custom storyboard in SwiftUI project and communication with it via UIViewControllerRepresentable
        * Use Photo Editor ( earlier version swift ). This is using UI with custom storyboard
    * ~~Custom AlertControlView via UIViewControllerRepresentable for getting 'name' text from user.~~ (not in use)

            * 'SourceKitService" and/or 'Swift' process on mac taking max memory, so xcode and all mac proccesses slogs to halt ( macOS Catalina 10.15.6, tried on XCode 11.6 and 11.5). The issue was solved after update of XCode 11.7.
    * Added Navigation view - 'Menu' option in content view. Now back and User Settings button on navigation bar. ( Menu items are seperated in 'Menu' option and 'Menu List' option views. )

    * This feature does not work for app in Simulator, but works on actual devices.
    * Issues - does not create proper mpeg file when we change the view or popup appears, while recording.
    * 'Screen Recording List' - Show list of these recording files with mpeg file thumbnail. 
        * On click open the mpeg file to play it.
        
15. SignatureListView - Usage of .svg files from assets (with photos and weblink to wikipedia.org)

    ![localizationLanguges](readmeResource/signaturesList.jpg)

21. Sample form with Inline error validation using combine. ( Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJRApch2cc4&feature=youtu.be )

22. iOS 14 or newer
    * Example usage of 
        * Custom colors based on .dark and .light display mode with help of UIColor+Extra.swift. The light and dark colors are defined in ColorScheme struct. ( The colors are NOT added in xcasset file ) (15-Dec-2021 .. continued)

        * TimelineView - Example 25 - Clock - Path Animations - selectable timezones (SanjaySwiftuiAnimations.swift)
            
24. XCTestCase - testing case creation started. ( Ref: SanjaySwiftUITests, TrialWorkTests )

* Important Note :-
    1. When SwiftUI does not have many views in a screen, the loading of App is faster. ( SwiftUI only loads views when they are seen on screen )
        * we should create small and multiple views in a screen, each view with single responsibility ( **S**OLID )
        * Each app screen should not be cluttered with many functionalities. 
        * The visibility of options and data should be easy to see for users.
